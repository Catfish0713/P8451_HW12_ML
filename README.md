propensity score
In class, I demonstrate how to use machine learning algorithms to create propensity scores. In the document (Demonstration_PropensityScore.RMD), there is an exercise left for you to do to.  For your assignment, you will complete this exercise and create propensity scores using the same dataset but a different machine learning algorithm than what was demonstrated in class. You can choose from any of the following algorithms: elastic net, LASSO, bagging ensemble, or boosting ensemble)

For your assignment, please upload a knit document that includes the code used to generate the propensity scores,  match individuals by propensity score and then assess the relationship between smoking and respiratory outcomes. Compare your results to the prior two algorithms (logistic regression and random forest) in terms of number of individuals included, the balance metric and estimated effect. Which model would you choose as your final model for this analysis?
